# *Who*?

The *answer* to ***Who is (working on) dwyl?***

There are two ways of discovering this list of people.

### 1. Visit the Org's People Page on GitHub

https://github.com/orgs/dwyl/people

### 2. List all Contributors to dwyl repos on GitHub

Read the Commit History for all the dwyl repos on GitHub!


Lets start with 1 and proceed to 2 when we have time.
(*and invite people to add their own bios & links*)

## Rough Sketch (*idea*)

# tl;dr

The people who contribute to [**dwyl**](https://github.com/dwyl)
expand on a *daily* basis (*this makes us happy!!*)

Scraping the [https://github.com/orgs/dwyl/**people**](https://github.com/orgs/dwyl/people)
page will only give us the people who have made their Org membership ***public***.
![dwyl people public](http://i.imgur.com/phxC512.png)

At the time of writing this, that is 25 people fewer than 40% of contributors.
(there are many out-standing invitations - thanks GitHub notifications! - and
  most people don't realise that they have to *manually* make their membership public...)
